    <h2>steps for preparing lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the béchamel sauce: Melt butter in a saucepan, add flour, then gradually pour in milk while stirring until thickened. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the meat: Sauté chopped onion and garlic in olive oil, then add the ground meat. Cook until the meat is browned.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce: Stir in the tomato sauce (or passata) with the meat, season with herbs (basil, oregano), and let it simmer.</li>
        <li>Prepare the lasagna pasta: If using dry pasta, cook it in boiling salted water according to the package instructions. If using no-boil sheets, skip this step.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: In a baking dish, layer the pasta, meat sauce, béchamel, and grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake: Top with more grated cheese and bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 30-40 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Let it rest: Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
